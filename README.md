# Hello :wave:

My name is Will Roehl. I am in my third year at Iowa State University where I am studying Aerospace Engineering.

Some of my hobbies include:
- Camping :tent:
- Hiking :sunrise_over_mountains:
- Reading :book:
- Astrophotography :milky_way:

I am very excited to learn about GitHub as I am brand new to it. With that being said, I look forward to always learning something new everytime I login!
In addition to learning GitHub, I am also learning LaTeX and C.

Here is my favorite photograph that I have ever taken of space!
